The database for this sample page is in firebase. And I have created a project file using teamechorw@gmail.com (our email address). So you can login and check the databse files there. Note that at the moment I haven't created any files for the database in this account as I have been playing around with my own account. Check that it works by irst registering you name and whatever sample things on the technican form and then you can retrieve it on the customer side but it will only filter out results if they match the "city" criteria.
